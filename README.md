# Telegram_Parsing_Bot

My first project

This bot helps a user to find a car with scraping technology via TelegramApi. The bot gets information from auto.ria.com. 
This is a website, you can find out info about a car and of course, you can buy it.Also, the bot uses for scraping only new car, not resealed or rented cars. 
I've used some Python directories for more capabilities. There are some of them: Pandas, Telebot, Requests, Beautifull Soup.  

P.S. This is my first project, don't shout at me pls. POG

Use only the main.py and csv files(csv files create automatically if you don't use them) to run this program.
Other Python's files uploaded only just for more understanding of how to work with main.py.

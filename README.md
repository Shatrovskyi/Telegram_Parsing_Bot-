# Telegram_Parsing_Bot

My first project

This is a bot that helps a user to find a car using scraping technology via TelegramApi. The bot gets information from auto.ria.com. 
This is the website you can find out info about a car and it's cost etc. Also the bot uses only new cars not resaled or not rented cars for scrapping. 
I have used some Python directories for more capabilities: Pandas, Telebot, Requests, BeautifulSoup.  

P.S. This is my first project, don't be scaptical at me pls. POG

Use only the main.py and csv files(csv files are created automatically if you don't use them) to run this program.
Other Python's files uploaded only just for better understanding how to work with main.py.
